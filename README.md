# TomTop Clone

TomTop is a web application that was built with the basic web tech stack for my web development class. We wanted to build this web app to help people have a better experience and more functionalities while browsing the groceries product. I'm sure many people would agree with me that our public is in need of a major upgrade, and this web app is just a small example of what our website could be like..
